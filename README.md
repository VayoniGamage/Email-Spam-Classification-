# ðŸ“§ Email Spam Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project is part of **CCS4340 â€“ Machine Learning** Lab Sheet 06. The aim is to implement a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier using Python and scikit-learn to detect whether an email is spam based on its metadata.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Understand the theory behind Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
- Implement a linear SVM classifier in Python.
- Visualize the decision boundary.
- Evaluate the classifier using real-world metrics.

---

## ðŸ“š Key Concepts

- **Support Vectors**: Critical data points that define the optimal separating hyperplane.
- **Margin Maximization**: SVM seeks the hyperplane with the maximum margin between classes.
- **Hyperplane**: A decision boundary that separates different classes in the feature space.
- **Kernel Trick**: Enables non-linear decision boundaries using kernel functions (Linear, Polynomial, RBF).

## ðŸ§  Applications of SVM

- Face detection
- Text classification
- Image recognition
- Bioinformatics

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset

- **Filename**: `email_spam_dataset.csv`
- **Features**:
  - `email_length`
  - `num_links`
  - `num_attachments`
  - `num_exclamations`
- **Target**: `is_spam` (0: Not Spam, 1: Spam)
